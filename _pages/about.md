Psychoanalysis has been an interesting topic in many different fields, including philosophy and film theories. The notion of love is always an important concept in psychoanalysis, and love, especially “romantic love,” is vital in our life. In our society today emphasizing “safety-first love” or “some comfort zones limited by regulated pleasures,” we believe there is an urgent need to rethink love. Therefore, in the Reading Psychoanalysis on Love series of events, we are going to explore the essential ideas of Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan (by Slavoj Žižek and Bruce Fink) and Alain Badiou on the topic of Love.

What is Psychoanalysis?
======
The primary definition of psychoanalysis is given by Sigmund Freud (Freud et al., 2016): psychoanalysis is a method of treating nervous patients medically. In the further development by French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, he innovated philosophical ideas into clinical psychoanalysis. For philosopher Slavoj Žižek, psychoanalysis is more than clinical treatments: it is also a way to read texts and decipher ideology in critical theories (Žižek et al., 2007).

What is psychoanalysis in critical theories? Critical Theory: The Key Concepts gives the following definition (Felluga, 2015):

> *Psychoanalytical Criticism aims to show that a literary or cultural work is always structured by complex and often contradictory human desires. Whereas New Historicism and Marx-inspired Cultural Materialism analyze public power structures in terms of the culture as a whole, psycho- analysis analyzes microstructures of power within the individual and within small-scale domestic environments. That is, it analyzes the interiority of the self as well as the self’s kinship systems. By analyzing the formation of the individual, psychoanalysis also helps us to understand the formation of ideology at large—and can therefore be extended to the analysis of various cultural and societal phenomena. Indeed, for this reason, psychoanalysis has been especially influential over the last three decades in cultural studies, film studies, and Marxist criticism.*

Why Love?
======
Love is a central theme in many people’s life, insofar as I know from past experience as a lover or a beloved. The notion of lover and beloved can be found in Plato’s famous text Symposium (Plato et al., 2003). The reading and the re-reading of this text always shed light on love in today’s society. The interactions of this idea from Plato with the psychoanalytic theories create space for us to rethink and even re-invent love, to put it in Alain Badiou’s term (Badiou et al., 2012).

There is another reason to introduce love from a psychoanalytic persepctive. In the clinical setting (possibly even in political theory) of Lacanian psychoanalysis, love is an indispensible concept in (Lacanian) psycho- analysis. Lacan once claimed (Lacan et al., 1999), “the only thing that we do in the analytic discourse is speak about love.” Thus we hope we will have an opportunity to glimpse this important notion of love and the elaboration of love from a psychoanalytic perspective, so that we can be motivated to at least think about love again.
