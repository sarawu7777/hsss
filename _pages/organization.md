Online synchronous sessions
------

Weekly (Bi-weekly during mid-term weeks) online synchronous sessions take place online. Since you are expected to be available, these will not recorded so people can freely participate. If this changes for any reason during the series of events, participants will be informed.
Participants may not create recordings of weekly synchronous events with the exception of those participants requiring an accommodation for a disability, who should speak to the organizer prior to beginning to record these events.

Case Study and Story Sharing

Case study materials will be prepared before the start of our final synchronous meeting. You are strongly encouraged to share the analysis of personal stories, films, texts and music related to the topic of our events. The sharing can be anonymous and be in different formats (writing, video, audio).
Do not download, copy, or share any materials or texts of the case study and other participants without the explicit permission of the organizers and the sharers. Thanks for your cooperation!
